# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this challenge was to analyse the performance of a school district on math and reading taking in to account diferent data such as funding and grades in order to discover new insights. The analysis of these high schools was done twice since a group of students committed an academic dishonesty and those results had to be errased.  

## Results:

As I already mensioned on the overview, this analysis had to be done twice because of an academic dishonesty of several students from Thomas High School. The results from those students that committed this dishonesty was not taken into acount which caused small changes on the analysis results. The following data frame shows the general school district results after this change was made:
