# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this challenge was to analyse the performance of a school district on math and reading taking in to account diferent data such as funding and grades in order to discover new insights. The analysis of these high schools was done twice since a group of students committed an academic dishonesty and those results had to be errased.  

## Results:

As I already mensioned on the overview, this analysis had to be done twice because of an academic dishonesty of several students from Thomas High School. The results from those students that committed this dishonesty was not taken into acount which caused small changes on the analysis results. The following data frame shows the general school district results after this change was made:

When the ninth grade students from Thomas High School where omitted from the calculations the school rankings remained the same but the overall passing percentage of the students decreased by 0.11%. 

### Insights:

Analysing the different data from the school district I was able to identify some insights that might help the district improve their performance. 

### School budget:

After analyzing the relation between the school budget and their results in reading and math, I was able to conclude that the students performance does not necessarily improve if they spend more money. Actually, the students who spent less money had better overall passing percentage. Schools should take this into considerations to make decisions. Data frame:
