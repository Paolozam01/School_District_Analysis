# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this challenge was to analyse the performance of a school district on math and reading taking in to account diferent data such as funding and grades in order to discover new insights. The analysis of these high schools was done twice since a group of students committed an academic dishonesty and those results had to be errased.  

## Results:

As I already mensioned on the overview, this analysis had to be done twice because of an academic dishonesty of several students from Thomas High School. The results from those students that committed this dishonesty was not taken into acount which caused small changes on the analysis results. The following data frame shows the general school district results after this change was made:

When the ninth grade students from Thomas High School where omitted from the calculations the school rankings remained the same but the overall passing percentage of the students decreased by 0.11%. 

### Insights:

Analysing the different data from the school district I was able to identify some insights that might help the district improve their performance. 

### School budget:

After analyzing the relation between the school budget and their results in reading and math, I was able to conclude that the students performance does not necessarily improve if they spend more money. Actually, the students who spent less money had better overall passing percentage. Schools should take this into considerations to make decisions. Data frame:

### School size:

Analyzing the relationship between the school size and the student performance in math and reading, it is clear that the school size does affect the students performance. As we can see on the following data frame, small and medium schools have an overall passing percentage over 90% while the larger schools have a lower percentage. This insight should be considered for future analysis and decisions. Data Frame:

## Summary:

Overall not taking into considerations the Thomas High School ninth grade students results affected a little bit the whole analysis. Somo of the most significant changes where the following:

- Thomas High School's overall passing percentageThomas High School lost its placement as a top five school within this District.  
- The whole district also had its average math and reading scores to fall. 
- Thomas High School was no longer a top five school in the district but had the second place when the ninth grade student count was not taken into consideration. 
- The overall passing percentage for students decreased. 

Editing data in order to eliminate values is something that is used in real life and it was helpful to learn how to do it with this challenge. The results of eliminating information in this database can be seen from the first analysis to this one. Thomas High School was affected a little by eliminating the grades of the ninth grade students. In this case the changes where not major, the school had a little decline in their overall passing percentages also decreasing the overall passing percentage for the whole district by a very little amount. In other cases where more data is eliminated or edited could cause bigger changes to the results and it is something that happens regularly in real life. I felt that learning how to edit and analize the results was very helpfull and I feel confident that I would be able to do this in a different scenario.
